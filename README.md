## Sports Search Engine
This command line application allows you to view or insert entries into a SQL database. The data is taken from the rushing & receiving table for the [1983 Nebraska Cornhuskers Stats](http://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/nebraska/1983.html#rushing_and_receiving::none).

### fiddle_wid_stats.py
This is where the main logic for the program lives. Running this file (with a correct path to the database in it) will allow you to view existing entries or insert new entries using command line arguments or not.

### inserter.py
This program allows you to add multiple lines of data to the database from a csv file. It also allows you to add single entries to the database in string format.
